### Tiny Organics

A simple Django application with a registration and a log-in with validations.

Successful login and registration redirects user to the home page that nests a form.

User enters child's information such as First and Last Name and Child's allergen,

the form should render a page with a list of Recipes not containing the allergen from 

Child's data.

#### Notes/Process:
* I used Python Tutor: (http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) to test my function.

* Decided to switch from django forms to a regular form instead and to implement the API call I had

to make from the Allergen API and used them in the form.

* I would add a link or a section in the homepage that houses a list of children.
